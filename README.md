# Chess Implementation in LWC

This chess implementation uses chessboard.js as the UI, and integrates it with the Stockfish Online API to put you up against the Stockfish Chess Engine.

Since chessboard.js only offers a Chess UI, Chess.js library is used to perform the moves returned by Stockfish Online API, and show them on the board.
